  <p>Founded in 2014, "The League" had it's humble beginnings at the storied Pi Kapp House at 777 Deakin Ave. The founders of this (at the time) fledgling redraft league were looking for any way possible to talk shit about the others that they lived with. In line with the broke college kids that made up the league, the trophy was small and simple, a bronze cup on a wooden base.</p>
  <p>Fast forward to the 2021 season, the inevitable happened. The trophy, with seven names now sharpied to the base (unfortunetly most of them being Kyle), broke in the mail on the way from Wisconsin to it's now resting place in California. Befitting of the incomes it's members now had, the league decided to go all out, purchasing a huge trophy to be passed from winner to winner. The trophy lists all previous winners and future winners in golden plaques at the base, though bragging rights and shit-talking continue to be the main prize.</p>
  <p>2022 marked the beginning of a new era. At the annual league meeting an idea was put forward, moving to a keeper league and ultimately a dynasty setup. The league moved offices from ESPN to the Sleeper App to accommodate this shift, and strategy became paramount.</p>
  <p>In astounding commitment to building a keeper and dynasty franchise, a few of the managers have even begun to have kids, grooming them to be the next generation of managers to take over their teams. The mini-managers are being heavily indoctrinated into the fantasy lifestyle, and will be expected to take an active role as soon as they can successfully put together a coherent trade offer.</p>
  <p>In contrast to the addition of the mini-managers, some managers are still as bad as they always have been. Those that have never won the 'ship, those that make shitty trades regularly, and those that we kicked out of the league for not setting their lineups on a regular basis (RIP Jake and Chach). We keep them in our thoughts and prayers as we continue to make better decisions.</p>
